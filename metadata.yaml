summary: Secure services with signed tls certificates

description: |
  Provides TLS certificates through the tls-certificates interface.

  Can be used either in a relationship with a proxy (currently only Haproxy) or by itself.

  This is for charms needing signed TLS certificates for their web services.

  Uses acme.sh under the hood for certificate handling.
